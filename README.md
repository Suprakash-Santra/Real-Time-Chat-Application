# Real-Time-Chat-Application
This project is a real-time chat application built using React for the frontend and PHP for the backend, with polling as the mechanism for live message updates. It features secure user login, multiple chat rooms, and dynamic message exchange between users. The frontend is developed with React and uses setInterval to poll the backend every few seconds for new messages, ensuring a near real-time experience. The backend is powered by PHP and communicates with a MySQL database to store and retrieve chat messages. Users can send and receive messages in different chat rooms, and the application handles message rendering, input, and API communication seamlessly. This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional real-time chat system without using WebSockets, making it suitable for environments where WebSocket support is limited or unavailable.
